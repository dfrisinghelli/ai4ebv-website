## Motivation

Mountain biodiversity is vital for the well-being of people and ecosystems, worldwide. Ecosystem extent and Ecosystem fragmentation are key priority EBVs to monitor and understand changes in mountain ecosystems and their species-level biodiversity. Maps of ecosystem distributions are needed to determine which and where areas are occupied by ecosystems and how these areas are affected by both natural and human disturbances.

**AI4EBV** will use Artificial Intelligence to address issues with validation and coarse spatial resolution of ecosystem maps, incorporating Earth observation (EO) data to produce these maps through time, thereby enabling a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem change and fragmentation. The project aims at contributing insights that support additional research and respond to key policy-relevant knowledge needs to support mountain biodiversity monitoring.

## Research questions

The project makes use of the World Terrestrial Ecosystems (WTE) map that was recently produced by [Sayre et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419307231?via%3Dihub) at a spatial scale of 250 m. While the WTEs map offers a unique spatial representation of terrestrial ecosystems, several open questions remain that influence its utility for a broad range of stakeholders:

1. How accurate is the map of ecosystems for mountain regions?
2. Can high-resolution Earth observation data be used to improve the spatial resolution and thematic content of the WTE map?
3. Can the WTE map be updated based on Earth observation data?
