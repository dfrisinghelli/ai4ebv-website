The World Terrestrial Ecoystems after [Sayre et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419307231?via%3Dihub) are based on a spatial integration of climate zones, landforms and land cover:

1. World Temperature Domains (TD):

  <em>The World Temperature Domains: Polar, Boreal, Cool Temperate, Warm Temperate, Subtropical, and Tropical.</em>
</p>

2. World Moisture Domains (MD):

  <img src="/media/WTE_Temperature.png">
  <em>The World Moisture Domains: Dry, Moist and Desert.</em>
</p>

3. World Landforms (LF):

  <em>The World Landforms: Mountains, Hills, Tablelands and Plains.</em>
</p>

4. World Vegetation and Land Cover (LC):

  <img src="/media/WTE_Temperature.png">
  <em>The World Vegetation and Land Cover: Forestlands, Shrublands, Grasslands, Bare Areas, Croplands, Water, Snow and Ice, and Settlements.</em>
</p>

The combination of climate zones, landforms and land cover types produces 576 possible combinations of World Terrestrial Ecosystems, of which 431 were realized:
