The World Terrestrial Ecoystems after [Sayre et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419307231?via%3Dihub) were developed using the [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) (FAO) and [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/) (IPCC) criteria for ecological zones and climate regions. The map is based on a spatial integration of climate zones, landforms and land cover:

1. A *World Temperature Domains* layer was developed by analyzing thousands of meteorological stations over a 30-year record of observations.

2. A *World Moisture Domains* layer was similarly developed from precipitation observations.

3. A *World Landforms* layer was derived by aggregating the global implementation of the Hammond landforms after [Karagulle et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12265).

4. A *World Vegetation and Land Cover* layer was derived from the ESA CCI global Land Cover [product 2015](http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download/ESACCI-LC-Ph2-PUGv2_2.0.pdf).

<p style="clear:both">
The combination of the climate and terrain types with the land cover types produces 576 possible combinations of World Terrestrial Ecosystems, of which 431 were realized:
