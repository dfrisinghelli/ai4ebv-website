The address the research questions, we focus on three different approaches:

1. Using AI and ground control points in the two mountain regions to assess the accuracy of the WTE data for those areas
2. Direct spatial downscaling of the existing 250 m ecosystem map to 30 m using high resolution EO data.
3. Downscaling of the WTE land cover information to generate first a high-resolution land cover map and convert this into a high-resolution ecosystem map following the approach by [Sayre et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419307231?via%3Dihub)
